Project Title: 
    
    Logic Tutor

Team Number: 

    Team #1; "Hooli-Strike Team"

Team/Product: 
    
    Logic Tutor 

Team members (list the name, git username, and email for each member): 

    [(Paul, , ); (Tory, , ); (Ben, , ); (Matt, , ); (Micah Simmerman, Micah614, jasi9001@colorado.edu) 

Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom)
    
    Weekly Team Meetings are on Mondays at 3:00 pm MST

Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
    
    Logic Tutor will improve your logic and reasoning ability with computer assisted training based on classical logic games.
  
Motivation: why are you working on this project?
        
    1.) This project appears managable to the skill levels of the members of the Hooli Strike Team.
    
    2.) Logic games are difficult to learn on your own. Computer assisted learning can help users improve their 
        skills and track their learning and achievements using specialized software tools. 

Risks to project completion; possibly including new language or working environment no prior experience working with 
these team members, lack of some needed resources, etc:
        
    -Team member schedule conflicts
    
    -Lack of familiarity with front-end game development
        
    -Lack of experience or familiarity with certain logic games
        
    -Difficulties agreeing on requirements, features, and timelines of completion

        
Mitigation Strategy for above risks (Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!)
        
    1.) Agile-Scrum: weekly sprints, design meetings, review and team retrospective meetings.
        
    2.) Pair-Programming: meeting in pairs to work on sections of the project.
        
    3.) Test-Driven Development: writing tests that demonstrate satisfactory performance with respect to user requirements.
