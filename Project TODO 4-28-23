Here is what I see as left do to accomplish currently, please let me know if you have run into anything else-

Website Functionality:
 * SET UP HOSTING ON LIVE SERVER

 * Pass cookie from login status and username to other pages 
 	* May need to store log-in status in database but probably not?
 	* Make splash page modal display only if logged in based on cookie
 		* Resume game button pulls data from Games_In_Progress table (update game, timer, difficulty, mistakes count)
 	* Display Username on main game page

 * Automatically create database entries for other tables when a user account is created

 * Display actual current game difficulty top left of main board

 * Create Games_In_Progress entry when new game started

 * Fix mistakes counter functionality - highlighting not being cleared on new input (Matt fix)
 * Fix mistake highlighting working with keypad input (Matt fix)

 * Save clock time on board input and game end (Ben/Matt)

 * Update User_Achievements based on Achievement_Stats table (Paul)

 * Do testing checks from PAGE_TESTING and SQL_TESTING and document

 * Gather documentation from coding comments

Presentation (5/4 at 5:30pm)
	* 10-15 minutes including demo
	* Topics to cover:
		Title of Project
		Team members' names
		Vision and Description of the Product

		All the tools your team used
		Name of the tool and purpose
		Your team's evaluation of the tool: Excellent? Useless?

		Challenges you encountered, how you overcame them, how your plans changed

		Demonstration of your project 

	* Deliverables:
		* Presentation is supposed to be "Manager to Manager" discussion of project
			* More of a retrospective on the process than a product pitch
		* Slide Deck
			* High level overview of goal of project
			* Show each tool
				* Evaluation of tools
				* Evaluation of processes
				* Tools to cover:
					project tracker
					version control
					database
					testing
					auto-documenter
					deployment environment
					programming languages and frameworks
					code editors
					anything else?
			* Challenges you encountered, how you overcame them, how your plans changed
		* Project Demo
			* Dr. Knox suggested pre-recording a demo (and could just be what we submit for the final project submission)
				* Record it with audio for final turn in but turn off audio and just talk live over it for presentation?

Final Submission (5/8):
	* Deliverable: Create a final report markdown file FINAL_REPORT.md with the following information:
		Project Title
		Team members' names
		Project tracker link (Instructor can access) - Trello Link
		Link to 5 minute video: a demo for a potential customer (could be same one you used in the presentation)
		Version control repository link (make sure the instructor(s) have access)
		Include a Final Status Report
			What you completed 
			What you were in the middle of implementing
			What you had planned for the future
			Any known problems (bugs, issues)
		List your public hosting site and make sure that it is available
		
	* Make sure that your repository has the following files committed to remote repository:
			REAMDE.md
			WEEKLY_STATUS.md
			PAGE_TESTING.md
			SQL_TESTING.md
			FINAL_REPORT.md
			Project presentation files from Milestone 5
			Video of demo
			Source code
			Test cases
			Source documentation, and auto-doc files
			Link to Public Deployment Site (Heroku or similar)
